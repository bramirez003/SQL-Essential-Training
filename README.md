# SQL-Essential-Training

Knowing how to code and manage relational databases and database-driven applications is a valuable skill for any career in tech. Completely updated for 2019, SQL Essential Training is designed to help users understand the most common language for database wrangling, SQL. All the lessons have been recorded in SQLiteStudio, an intuitive and easy-to-install database manager. Instructor Bill Weinman teaches all the major features of SQL: creating tables; defining relationships; manipulating strings, numbers, and dates; using triggers to automate actions; and using subselects and views. He offers a solid working knowledge of the language and shows how to retrieve and manage data efficiently. The final chapter includes a real-world example of building a simple application using SQL.

This course was created by Bill Weinman. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.
